# Library
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

### Functionality

This is the [Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/library) project, where I practice some Javascript by creating a very simple display of a list of book objects, along with buttons to remove them and toggle their "read" status.

### Thoughts

Since I've been going through the Rails lessons for so long, my Javascript grew rusty. Once I got going it wasn't too bad though, and it all quickly came back to me. There were many instances in which I instinctively thought to reach for Rails helper methods, and had to shift my thinking back to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. It was a simple enough project, and a good way to jump back into Javascript.

God bless.
