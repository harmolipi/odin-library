# Library
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

## Functionality

This is the [Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/library) project, where I practice some Javascript by creating a very simple display of a list of book objects, along with buttons to remove them and toggle their "read" status.

## Thoughts

Since I've been going through the Rails lessons for so long, my Javascript grew rusty. Once I got going it wasn't too bad though, and it all quickly came back to me. There were many instances in which I instinctively thought to reach for Rails helper methods, and had to shift my thinking back to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. It was a simple enough project, and a good way to jump back into Javascript.

There was an optional step of the project, which was to save the list of books to [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API) and load from it when the page is loaded. I managed to implement this, and while it was my first time using localStorage, fortunately it was pretty straightforward.

It's also worth mentioning that since my focus was on the Javascript functionality of this practice project, I didn't put any effort into styling it at all. I did add the classless CSS framework, [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/), to make it look slightly less basic, at least.

### Mini part 2

Returned to this project after [learning about classes](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/classes) in order to refactor my Book objects to be created with a class, rather than a constructor function.

God bless.
